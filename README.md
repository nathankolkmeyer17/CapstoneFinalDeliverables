# CapstoneFinalDeliverables
Program has implmentations of different skeletons within MinWeightTriangulation commented out. The program runs a given point set "300Points.txt" and then attempts to run through the selected skeletons and output the number of edges removed and time. The program can be edited within MinWeighTriangulation and MyCanvas to output the MWT as an image for small point sets. Current skeleton is the simplified LMT-Skeleton, to change them or add more simple uncomment the repsect areas with MinWeightTriangulation, directly below removing the convex hull edges.

MyCanvas also contains a loop under the call to MinWeightTriangulation that produces random files as well as another that produce result files by testing each file in the MWT.
